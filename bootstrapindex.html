I'm Ashley.</h2><p>I am currently pursuing my MS in Information Management at the University of Washingtonâ€™s Information School, with specializations in User Experience and Information Architecture. The MSIM program combines technical knowledge with business management practices to prepare its students for working in the Information industry. It is a very interdisciplinary program, and being a two year program instead of one allows students to gain both breadth and depth in their chosen specializations.</p>

    <div class="stuff" data-type="content"><h2>The User Experience of History</h2>The fields of history, information architecture, and user experience have more in common than one might expect. All three require the distillation of information from the noisy to the usable. Historians are asked to look at the human past, and amidst this sea of information, distill what pieces are important, which ones are related, and how they explain things. They then must be able to communicate them, in a manner appropriate to their audience. <br><br>

The filed of UX asks its practitioners to accomplish a similar task. In information architecture, a client will have an information problem, and they need to be able to make sense of it, organize and structure it, and put it together to tell a coherent story. The UX design ensures the clear communication of this information, and together the information that was once just a mess of noise is now usable and understandable.

    <div class="stuff" data-type="content">I have been teaching myself to code for the past year. I have written the majority of the code for this site by hand. This site is a place for me to share my UX portfolio as I progress through my studies, but it also will serve as a coding playground as I develop my coding skills. <br><br>

It might not be the prettiest site out there, but I'm proud of it.</div>
